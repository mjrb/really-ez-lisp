# really-ez-lisp
i found out some variants of sql are turning complete so i decided i would write a compiler to compile lisp to sql.  
obviosly i would have to write the compiler in the lisp compiler itself, so first im writing really ez lisp to boot strap it. and then i can finnaly start writing the actual compiler to sql.
## reasons why you should use this
none, please don't ask me for support either  
this is an education project so its probably not that great
there are tons of other silly language compilers on github, you'd probably be better off with one of those.

## types
- int
- pointer
- function
thats all you get. 

## why pointer and no list
because then you can make arrays and linked lists yourself. stop trying to get me to do everything for you.

## why lisp
brainf\*\*\* would have been too easy  
all the cool kids use lisp
