# Really Ez Lisp
a toy lisp compiler started for a very stupid reason

## goals
- compile down to more native like go
- make webasebly and myssql targets happen
- make error checker? debugging is really painful
- file io
- named function arguments and named referenes
- maybe some lazy evaluation so `(if (0) (print "booo!!!"))` don't print out booo!!!

## how to compile
`go run reallyezylisp.go -i <input file>`outputs to out.go
`go run reallyezylisp.go -i <input file> -o <outputname>`outputs to <outputname>.go
## how to run
`go run <whatever>.go`


## things you can do
- `+ - * /`
- unary / is same as 1/x
- unary -
- `(if (condintion) (what to return if true) (what to return if not true))`
- `(use somthing)` copy paste contents from file named somthing. hopefuly its go code
- `(import somthing)` parse Really Ez Lisp from file called somthing.
- `(fn main (somthing))` this somthing is all that will actually be done
- `(fn yourFuncHere (do somthing) (actually return somthing))` func names have to be valid go names, sorry ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø. also only last statment is returned
- `(fn example (+ $0 1)))` $n gives the nth argument supplied to the function. (terrible!!!)
- `(list 1 2 3 4)` make list [1 2 3 4]
- `(get 0 (list 1 2))` gets element 0
- `(get 1 2 (list 0 1 2 3))` gets elements 1-2
- `(get 1 2 (list 0 1 2 3)(list 0 1 2 3))` returns list of sublists you asked for. im verry proud of this one!!!
- `(len (list 1 2 3))` this should be obvious, but this language does have this feature
- `(print 123)` prints 123
- `(printc 127829)` print whatever character. in this case üçï
- `(printc '\n')` print newline character
- `(printc "Hello, World!\n")` no one has ever done this before
- `(printc (list 72 101 108 108 111 44 32 87 111 114 108 100 33 10))` same effect as above, but no one has wanted to do this before

## currently busted
- probably a lot of things ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
- $n) tends to get lexed as [$,n)] instead of [$,n] like its supposed to (i would like to solve this but its 5 am)
- the example file has an example of merge sort but the above error broke it
